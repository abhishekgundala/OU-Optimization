**Enhancing Hospital Observation Unit Efficiency Using Predictive Models**

This project focuses on optimizing the efficiency of Montanaro Hospital's Observation Unit (OU) by predicting patient transitions to inpatient care. By leveraging data and machine learning models, we aim to improve patient flow, reduce hospital overcrowding, and optimize resource allocation.

**Project Overview**

**Objective**: Predict which patients in the Observation Unit are likely to transition to inpatient care, helping improve patient flow and resource utilization.
Data Source: Hospital patient data, including length of stay, patient demographics, and insurance types.
Key Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
Key Features

**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed patient demographics, length of stay, and insurance types to uncover patterns influencing patient transitions.
Predictive Modeling: Developed decision trees, logistic regression, and random forest models to predict transitions to inpatient care.
Model Performance: Evaluated accuracy, confusion matrices, and AUC scores to assess each model's ability to classify patient outcomes.
Insights & Recommendations

**Length of Stay as a Key Factor**: Identified length of stay (LOS) as the most significant predictor of patient transitions to inpatient care.
Optimized LOS Threshold: Implemented a 70.25-hour LOS threshold to aid in decision-making for patient transitions.
Actionable Recommendations: Streamlined protocols for patient evaluations based on predictive models, improving hospital efficiency and patient care.
Tools & Libraries

Languages: R, Python
